# Abstract
Crime in urban areas is not random and it reflects deeper social and economic realities. This study
explores how factors like income inequality, unemployment, housing trends, and the COVID-19
pandemic have shaped crime patterns in Los Angeles from 2020 to 2025. Using over one million LAPD
crime records combined with census and housing data, we analyzed these relationships through
exploratory data analysis and machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest,
and XGBoost. Our findings show that crime clusters in neighborhoods facing economic hardship, with
vehicle theft and identity fraud dominating property crimes, while violent offenses follow distinct
demographic and time-based patterns. The pandemic disrupted these trends, reducing street crimes but
increasing domestic violence and cybercrime. Gentrification lowered crime in revitalized areas but
displaced it to nearby communities, reinforcing inequality. Among predictive models, XGBoost delivered
the best performance, highlighting the importance of contextual and location-based features. These
insights suggest that effective crime prevention requires more than policing. It demands policies that
address housing affordability, job access, and community resilience. By linking data-driven analysis with
social policy, this research offers a roadmap for creating safer, more equitable cities.
